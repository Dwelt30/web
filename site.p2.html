As an adult, Mozart worked at a post in Salzburg writing various types of music. He continued to travel, writing works and playing in cities across Europe. In 1777, he met Aloysia Weber, a singer, with whom he fell in love. In 1778, as he was writing a symphony in D major (K 297), his mother fell ill, and she died on July 3, soon after its premiere. Upon her death, Mozart returned to Salzburg. In December, he returjed to see Aloysia, who ignored him for other admirers. When asked why in her later years, she said, "I did not know, you see. I only thought... he was such a little man." Mozart would go on to marry Aloysia's younger sister, Constanze, and seemed to have a happy relationship with her. In his later years, he suffered from depression, and developed issues with alcohol and gambling, while both he and his wife had issues with overspending. However, he continued traveling and composing. Mozart began composing his famous requiem, which was commissioned by a mysterious figure who wished that the transaction be kept secret. The commissioner was Count Franz von Walsegg, who wanted the piece to pass off as his own work, potentially for his wife's funeral. As Mozart composed this, he became sick, of what is now thought to be a streptococcal infection, and died before he could finish the Requiem, at the age of 35. In his last four months, he also managed to compose The Magic Flute, La Clemenza di Tito, and his Clarinet Concerto. However, the circumstances of his death left a lot of room for speculation at the time. He was terrified by the mysterious figure, and rumors began that Salieri, a musical rival, had poisoned him and commissioned the Requiem as a taunt.
