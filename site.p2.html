As an adult, Mozart worked at a post in Salzburg writing various types of music. He continued to travel, writing works and playing in cities across Europe. In 1778, as he was writing a symphony in D major (K 297), his mother fell ill, and soon after its premiere, she died. Upon her death, Mozart returned to Salzburg. In his later years, he suffered from depression, but continued traveling and composing. As he was composing his famous requiem, he died at the age of 35.
