<h1>Final Project</h1>
<div class="body2">
  <p>This project will take any csv file and determine the type of graph that should be used to present it, then output html code to present the data on a webpage. It looks for the types of data, such as integers, decimal values, or words, and the number of headers, to determine the type of graph to generate. These graphs could be line graphs, scatter plots, histograms, or bar graphs. For example, data with only one header or with word values might be more suited to a histogram, while data with a variety of categorical headers might be better suited to a bar graph. Numerical data organized sequentially might be better suited to a line graph, while numeral data in a random order might be better suited to a scatter plot. These plots will be chosen, and then the program will output a string of html code to present the data in a table and in the chosen graph. The pages linked are examples generated using the python program with different csvs used in class.</p>
