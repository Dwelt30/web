Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was largely propelled into music by his father, Leopold Mozart, a violinist and composer from Salzburg. He learned the harpsichord and violin, and exhibited an imense amount of talent. His first tour of Europe was at the age of six with his older sister, who he called Nannerl, escorted by his parents. Both children were immensely talented, but Wolfgang was the one who would continue in music. On this tour, the Mozarts entertained nobility, from whom they recieved various gifts. Mozart even met Empress Maria Theresa. On this tour, Mozart's father wrote letters home to their landlord and friend. These letters, along with later ones between various members of the Mozart family from various travels, have been published and are available as a valuable primary source on the life of Mozart. By the age of seven, Wolfgang had published four violin and piano sonatas, dedicated to Princess Victoire, daughter of Louis XV. Throughout his life, he continued this trend of prodigious composition and musicianship, maintaining a celebrity status.

As an adult, Mozart worked at a post in Salzburg writing various types of music. He continued to travel, writing works and playing in cities across Europe. In 1778, as he was writing a symphony in D major (K 297), his mother fell ill, and soon after its premiere, she died. Upon her death, Mozart returned to Salzburg. In his later years, he suffered from depression, but continued traveling and composing. As he was composing his famous requiem, he died at the age of 35.

<h2>Music</h2>

Mozart's work was definitively classical, but innnovative. At the time of its composition, it was considered not only genius, but difficult. His famous opera Don Giovanni was considered "complex and dissonant," and his chamber music was difficult to interpret. His three most famous operas, Don Giovanni, Le Nozze di Figaro, and Die Zauberflote, were consistently enjoyed by the public, as they are engaging, with comfortable styles and a few immature jokes. His later works, especially the minor key concertos, erred towards being more romantic in style. Although often exaggerated, Mozart maintained a childish sense of humor that can be seen in his music. His manuscripts show a remarkable lack of revisions, and seem to indicate that he wrote his music down almost fully formed. Currently, he is regarded as a complex, formidable composer, and definitely a challenge to play. He wrote for many instruments as though for solo violin, and even made a point of writing the Queen of the Night aria from the Magic Flute to be almost impossible to sing.
