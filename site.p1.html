Wolfgang Amadeus Mozart was largely propelled into music by his father, Leopold Mozart, a violinist and composer from Salzburg. He learned the harpsichord and violin, and exhibited an imense amount of talent. His first tour of Europe was at the age of six with his older sister, who he called Nannerl, escorted by his parents. Both children were immensely talented, but Wolfgang was the one who would continue in music. On this tour, the Mozarts entertained nobility, from whom they recieved various gifts. Mozart even met Empress Maria Theresa. On this tour, Mozart's father wrote letters home to their landlord and friend. These letters, along with later ones between various members of the Mozart family from various travels, have been published and are available as a valuable primary source on the life of Mozart. By the age of seven, Wolfgang had published four violin and piano sonatas, dedicated to Princess Victoire, daughter of Louis XV. Throughout his life, he continued this trend of prodigious composition and musicianship, maintaining a celebrity status.
