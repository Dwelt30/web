Mozart's work was definitively classical, but innnovative. At the time of its composition, it was considered not only genius, but difficult. His famous opera Don Giovanni was considered "complex and dissonant," and his chamber music was difficult to interpret. His three most famous operas, Don Giovanni, Le Nozze di Figaro, and Die Zauberflote, were consistently enjoyed by the public, as they are engaging, with comfortable styles and a few immature jokes. His later works, especially the minor key concertos, erred towards being more romantic in style. Although often exaggerated, Mozart maintained a childish sense of humor that can be seen in his music. His manuscripts show a remarkable lack of revisions, and seem to indicate that he wrote his music down almost fully formed. Currently, he is regarded as a complex, formidable composer, and definitely a challenge to play. He wrote for many instruments as though for solo violin, and even made a point of writing the Queen of the Night aria from the Magic Flute to be almost impossible to sing.
